## This is my project in Python class (teacher: Tran Duc Nguyen) at my university.  
**Motivation: Cars are one of the things that I really enjoy. This dataset is about cars and I can practice my learned skills.**  
This app is to evaluate which car is acceptable, unacceptable, good or very good. We input the features of a car and we will see the results.  

**The things that I learned from this app:**
1. More fluently with **streamlit**
2. Dealing with data
3. Deploy to **heroku**
4. Write README github

**To conclude, this is just a simple app and I want to do more interesting things in the future.**
