# Car Evaluation Web App
## This is my project in Python class (teacher: Tran Duc Nguyen) at my university.
**Motivation: Cars are the thing that I pay attention to when I ride on the street.**
This app is to evaluate which car is acceptable, unacceptable, good or very good. 
We input the features of a car and we will see the results.
The things that I learned from this app:
1. More fluently with streamlit
2. Dealing with raw data
3. Deploy to heroku
4. Write README github
**To conclude, this is just a simple app and I want to do more interesting things in the future.**
